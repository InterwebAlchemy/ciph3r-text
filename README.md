# Ciph3rText

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f66db83-ceb6-4625-a90b-f5615687e630

A React Component that animates transforming a string of text:

- `encode`: slowly scramble the text by replacing characters
- `decode`: start with scrambed text and unscramble it by replacing characters and slowly revealing the text
- `transform`: convert one string into another by padding it with random characters or removing extra characters while slowly revealing the target text

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```sh
# use npm, bun, yarn, pnpm, etc.
npm install @interwebalchemy/ciph3r-text
```

```
bun add @InterwebAlchemy/ciph3r-text
```

Import the package:

```tsx
import Ciph3rText from "@interwebalchemy/ciph3r-text";
```

Render the Component:

```tsx
<Ciph3rText defaultText="https://interwebalchemy.com/" action="decode" />
```

## Configuration

There are some configuration options you can use:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| **Property** | **Description** | **Type** | **Default** |
| -----------  | --------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `defaultText` **required** | the text to display during server rendering, after decoding, or before encoding or transforming | `string` | `undefined` |
| `action` | controls whether the text is `encoded`, `decoded`, or `transformed` | `"encode"` | `"decode"`, `"endcode"`, or `"transform"` |
| `targetText` *required if `action="transform"`* | the text to transform into when using `action="transform"` | `string` | `undefined` |
| `onFinish` | callback to execute when the `defaultText` has ben fully decoded, encoded, or transformed | `() => {}` | `undefined` |
| `iterationSpeed` | how frequently the logic to scramble characters executes | `number` | `120`; `150` (`transform`) |
| `maxIterations` | how many times the logic to scramble/unscramble characters can run | `number` | `36`; `54` (`transform`) |
